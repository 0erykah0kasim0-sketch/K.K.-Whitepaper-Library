# DARPA Concept Notes Archive  
### K.K. Conceptual Modules Collection (v1.0)

This archive collects all of K.K.’s high-concept DARPA-style submissions,  
including field theories, maneuver models, energetic frameworks,  
environmental dynamics, aerospace concepts, and multi-domain operating logic.

These notes represent the *conceptual frontier* of Civilization Engineering —  
independent modules that may evolve into full OS layers or Island-OS components.

## 🗂 Folder Purpose

This directory serves as the **concept module archive** for all DARPA-style notes.  
Each whitepaper inside this directory may:

- evolve into a full OS module  
- integrate with Island-OS  
- connect to ND-OS as extended field logic  
- function as standalone conceptual research  
- expand into v2.0, v3.0... as needed  

All files adopt the naming rule:
